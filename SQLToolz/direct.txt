" This file is used to store reserved words for direct execution
" as opposed to a select statement.  Only lines beginning with '
" (single quote) are read.  The first group of entries show
" the commands which are hard coded in the application.  The second
" group of entries are entries which have been added specifically
" for this implementation.  Valid entries must be enclosed in single
" quotes.  Entries must be made in a manner which will allow the
" parser to identify them in the context of an sql statement.  In
" most cases this can be done by including a space after the word.
" This file is read at database login, so if you add a word to it,
" you can just login to the database again to have it included.
